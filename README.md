## Project Description
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset using a logistic regression model to predict whether a tweet expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The workflow includes the following steps:

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Checking for Missing Values:** Identifying and handling any missing data to ensure the dataset is complete.
2. **Stemming:** Reducing words to their base or root form to normalize the data.
3. **Extracting Stop Words:** Removing common words that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the text, such as 'and', 'the', 'is', etc.

### Model Training
1. **Feature Extraction:** Converting text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
2. **Logistic Regression Model:** Training a logistic regression model on the preprocessed dataset to classify tweets as having positive or negative sentiment.

### Evaluation
- Assessing the performance of the logistic regression model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the model's effectiveness.

This project demonstrates the entire process of building a sentiment analysis model, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, providing valuable insights into the sentiment expressed in tweet
